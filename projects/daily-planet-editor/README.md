# daily-planet-editor

This is the file associated with the Daily Planet Editor project, which can be found at [coursework.vschool.io/daily-planet-editor/](http://coursework.vschool.io/daily-planet-editor/)

For this Project all I had to do was debug the code and help make it more readable with better syntax and using javascript conventions.
