                <p>
                    I took two semesters of college decided to take a java class. I enjoyed the programming but did not enjoy the college experience. I had made a snake game and was hooked from there. It really sparked my curiosity so I started taking courses online and learning as much as i could and began to make weird projects of my own. I decided to take a full-stack JavaScript course in Salt Lake City, Utah. This is where I went to Vschool learning about full-stack web development with the React framework.
