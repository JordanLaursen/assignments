                    Just this last week a man by the name of Jared Ryan was going for a walk in his local woodlands. He was one of the lucky people that are still alive when being confronted by a bear, but Jared's story is particularly crazy. While Jared was on his walk he needed to use the restroom. Like any other man he went into the bushes to do his business, but smack dab in the middle of his bathroom break a bear approached him. Like any normal person Jared crapped himself but his pants were already off so he was good to go. Largely to his surprise the bear crouched over next to him and joined him. once the two were finished both the bear and Jared grabbed a large leaf and wiped, the bear even helped Jared get a larger leaf from higher in the tree and handed it to him and went on it's way. While continuing to go

                    on his walk Jared had made it about 5 miles into unfamiliar woods. He decided he wanted to just keep going until he could find a road. While on his walk Jared ended up smelling something extremely stinky. in order to figure out the scent Jared followed where his nose took him and found a big pile of sticks and discovered the source of the scent. An eight foot tall unfamiliar beast was staring at him. To Jared's surprise it had looked exactly what he had imagined Bigfoot to look like, and that's exactly what it was, a giant Bigfoot. Jared was paralyzed with fear, but Bigfoot remained calm and had walked over to Jared holding a dead raccoon. Generously Bigfoot handed the dead raccon to Jared and it seemed like Bigfoot wanted Jared to eat it. Obviously Jared didn't want to eat a raccoon but Bigfoot was

                    getting upset and started growling at Jared with a deep rumble. Jared decided to take a bite and Bigfoot had calmed back down and seemed happy seeing Jared put on a fake smile. Luckily Bigfoot was exhausted and wanted to nap, but unfortunately Bigfoot grabbed Jared and began to cuddle with him. Jared was forced to do many tedious tasks for Bigfoot for about a week until he was too stinky for Bigfoot and got kicked out of Bigfoot's stick house. Luckily Jared was only half a mile from a back road and knew exactly where he was and walked home and showered to find out he had rabies from eating wild animals all week. Jared was checked into his local hospital and treated for his rabies and had been staying at the hospital where the story had gained popularity and people were amazed.
